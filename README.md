These are Python networking scripts inspired by Black Hat Python.

## TCP Client

In the world of penetration testing, we often need a **TCP client** to send garbage data or perform fuzzing. Relying on online scripts or tools won't help us develop our skills as pentesters. We need to be able to create a **TCP client** easily.

## UDP Client

On the other hand, UDP clients are equally important in pentesting when you need to send quick, connectionless packets without the overhead of establishing a session. UDP is often used by protocols such as DNS, DHCP, or custom application protocols. Crafting your own UDP client lets you send crafted payloads or fuzz datagram-based services effectively. Understanding how to send and receive UDP packets increases your versatility in testing a broader range of networked applications.
