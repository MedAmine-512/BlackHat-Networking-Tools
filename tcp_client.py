'''
The b before the string (b"...") means that this is a byte string in Python.
When working with sockets, data is usually sent and received in bytes rather than regular strings.

responde = client.recv(4096) # 4Kb

'''
4096  represents the buffer size, meaning the maximum number of bytes the program will read from the server's response at a time.

It can be changed response by using a loop till no more data is received


while True:
    chunk = s.recv(4096)
    if not chunk:
        break
    response += chunk

print(response.decode())  # Print full response
